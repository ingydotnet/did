=head1 Description

Docker ID container images (dids) are regular Docker container images that
report identification information about themselves. That is, you can ask an
image for information about what a container does and how to call it. This
information is available in both human readable and machine readable form.

The C<did> command is a tool for more easily finding and interacting with
these images. You can do things like the following:

=over

=item * Search for known dids

=item * Ask the did for a man page

=item * Ask the did for its identification info (in JSON or YAML)

=item * List the commands (entrypoints) of a did

=item * Print a C<docker run ...> command for an entrypoint

=item * Run a did command

=back

=head1 Installation

Currently there are 2 ways to install the C<did> command. You can:

    git clone git@github.com:ingydotnet/did
    # Add this line to your Bash or Zsh startup:
    source /path/to/did/.rc

The did commands currently have various runtime dependencies. If you want to
avoid installing these dependencies, you are in luck, because the did tool
itself has been packaged as a did. Just run this alias command and you should
be ready to go:

    alias did='docker run -it --entrypoint /did dids/did'
