= Description

Docker ID container images (dids) are regular Docker container images that
report identification information about themselves. That is, you can ask an
image for information about what a container does and how to call it. This
information is available in both human readable and machine readable form.

The `did` command is a tool for more easily finding and interacting with these
images. You can do things like the following:

* Search for known dids
* Ask the did for a man page
* Ask the did for its identification info (in JSON or YAML)
* List the commands (entrypoints) of a did
* Print a `docker run ...` command for an entrypoint
* Run a did command

= Installation

Currently there are 2 ways to install the `did` command. You can:

  git clone git@github.com:ingydotnet/did
  # Add this line to your Bash or Zsh startup:
  source /path/to/did/.rc

The did commands currently have various runtime dependencies. If you want to
avoid installing these dependencies, you are in luck, because the did tool
itself has been packaged as a did. Just run this alias command and you should
be ready to go:

  alias did='docker run -it --entrypoint /did dids/did'
