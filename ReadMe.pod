=head1 Description

Docker ID container images (dids) are regular Docker container images that
report identification information about themselves. That is, you can ask an
image for information about what a container does and how to run it. This
information is available in both human readable and machine readable form.

The C<did> command is a tool for more easily finding and interacting with
these images. You can do things like the following:

=over

=item * Search for known dids

=item * Ask the did for a man page

=item * Ask the did for its dockerid info (in JSON or YAML)

=item * List the commands (entrypoints) of a did

=item * Print a C<docker run ...> command for an entrypoint

=item * Run a did command
